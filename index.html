                <h5>The franchise began in 1971 with the Kamen Rider television series, which followed college student
                    Takeshi Hongo and his quest to defeat the world-conquering Shocker organization. The original series
                    spawned television and film sequels and launched the Second Kaiju Boom (also known as the Henshin
                    Boom) on Japanese television during the early 1970s, impacting the superhero and action-adventure
                    genres in Japan</h5>

            <div class="quote">Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story
                the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and
                so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge
                of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force
                is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he
                was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
                apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others
                from death, but not himself.</div>
